\begin{cvsubsection}{Student Asisstant}{TU Clausthal, Datacenter}{Apr 2016 -- April 2020}

\begin{itemize}
\item I created knowledge via building a proof of concept for deploying Virtual Tunnel End Points (VTEPs) with Ansible on Linux machines for EVPN BGP/VXLAN.
\item I reduced toil from multiple hours to an automated system with automating daily email based firewall IPS/IDS alerts via the Forcepoint NGFW Python API.
\item I improved system security and reliability with setting up an OpenVAS vulnerability scanner.
\item I reduced MTTR from one work day to one hour with automating a Freeradius/Radsecproxy/MySQL based AAA infrastructure with Ansible.
\item I increased virtual machine reliability via creating and maintaining a Proxmox VE cluster consisting of 25 machines.
\item I reduced toil from multiple hours to an automated system with writing a Python client for deploying TLS certificates and private keys on a Forcepoint NGFW for TLS inspection.
\item My current job also involves evaluating Kubernetes for increasing reliability and introducing micro segmentation via namespace segregation and implementing my bachelor thesis project on-premise with new additions (Traefik as reverse proxy and load balancer for Prometheus and Grafana).
\item Additional tasks were/are monitoring (NSCA, NRPE, SNMP), webserver (Nginx, Apache), network Automation (NAPALM, Ansible), storage (NFSv4 over Kerberos), log and netflow gathering (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and Configuration Management (Ansible).
\item I gave a talk about Freeradius and Radsecproxy deployment via Ansible on the DFN-BT (annual German Research Network Meetup): \url{https://www.dfn.de/fileadmin/3Beratung/Betriebstagungen/bt70/BT70_MobileIT_Konfiguration_FreeRADIUS_und_radsecproxy_mit_Ansible_Strauf_Rebischke.pdf}
\end{itemize}

\begin{cvsubsection}{Student Assistant}{TU Clausthal Inst. of Software Systems Engineering}{Oct 2016 -- Sep 2017}
\bigskip
\begin{itemize}
\item I build a tool chain for exporting Matlab Simulink models into the Functional Mockup Unit (FMU) format.
\item I developed components for a model transformation tool suite in the project \emph{Spectral Analsysis of Software Architecture}
\item I enhanced code quality with establishing the Continuous Code Quality tool Sonarqube.
\item I used the following technologies for accomplishing these tasks: Java, Gradle, Matlab, SVN
\end{itemize}
\end{cvsubsection}

\begin{cvsubsection}{Student Assistant}{TU Clausthal Inst. of Mathematics}{Apr 2014 -- Sep 2017}
\bigskip
\begin{itemize}
\item I increased system reliability with monitoring via the Nagios fork Centreon and using the protocols NRPE, NSCA, SNMP.
\item I reduced toil with building linux packages for Ubuntu and CentOS.
\item I have administrated Linux and Windows machines and gave first level support.
\item Furthermore I have wrote bash scripts, created a NFSv4 server with Kerberos, managed Apache webserver, CUPS printing server, a Firefox sync server for bookmarks and passwords, and a MySQL server.
