\begin{cvsection}{Employment}
\begin{cvsubsection}{Work Student}{Avency, Remote}{Apr 2020 --- Now}
\begin{itemize}
\item Showed Ownership in maintaining an on-premise Kubernetes Cluster
\item Developed a package manager for deploying static binaries in Golang for NextGen Firewalls.
\end{itemize}
\end{cvsubsection}
\begin{cvsubsection}{Student Assistant}{TU Clausthal, Datacenter}{Apr 2016 --- Apr 2020}

\begin{itemize}
\item Wrote a software that helps finding unused or orphaned artifacts in the firewall and therefore reduced the manual task of searching for it.
\item Built a proof of concept for deploying Virtual Tunnel End Points (VTEPs) with Ansible on Linux machines for EVPN BGP/VXLAN.
\item Implemented an automated system in Python for fetching IPS firewall alerts via REST API and mailing them to responsible system administrators. This reduced the toil of writing 5--25 mails daily.
\item Improved system security and reliability by setting up an OpenVAS vulnerability scanner.
\item Reduced MTTR from one work day to one hour by automating a Freeradius/Radsecproxy based AAA infrastructure with Ansible.
\item Showed ownership by maintaining a Proxmox VE cluster consisting of 25 physical nodes.
\item Designed and implemented a command line tool in Python for deploying TLS certificates and private keys on a central firewall for inbound TLS inspection.
\item Evaluated Kubernetes for increasing reliability and introducing micro segmentation via namespace segregation
\item Set up a distributed monitoring system with the help of Traefik, Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring Service Level Indicators (SLIs) for different institutions within the university campus.
\item Gave a talk about Freeradius and Radsecproxy deployment via Ansible on the DFN-BT (annual German research network meetup) \endnote{\url{https://www.dfn.de/fileadmin/3Beratung/Betriebstagungen/bt70/BT70_MobileIT_Konfiguration_FreeRADIUS_und_radsecproxy_mit_Ansible_Strauf_Rebischke.pdf}}
\item Achieved a relation of LDAP users and IP addresses for writing user/IP specific firewall rules via implementing a REST API as middleware between a proprietary service, Freeradius and OpenVPN.
\item Additional key technologies being used: NSCA, NRPE, SNMP, Nginx, Apache, NAPALM, NFSv4 over Kerberos, Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Ansible, Python-Flask, Docker, Git.
\end{itemize}
\end{cvsubsection}

\begin{cvsubsection}{Student Assistant}{TU Clausthal Inst.\@ of Software Systems Engineering}{Oct 2016 --- Sep 2017}

\item Built a tool chain for exporting Matlab Simulink models into the Functional Mockup Unit (FMU) format.
\item Developed components for a model transformation tool suite in the project \emph{Spectral Analsysis of Software Architecture}
\item Enhanced code quality by establishing the Continuous Code Quality tool Sonarqube.
\item Key technologies being used: Java, Gradle, Matlab, SVN
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Increased system reliability by monitoring via the Nagios fork Centreon.
\item Build software packages for Ubuntu (deb) and CentOS (rpm).
\item Has been the system administrator for Linux and Windows machines and gave first level support.
\item Technologies being used: Bash, NFSv4 with Kerberos, Apache, CUPS, MySQL\@.
