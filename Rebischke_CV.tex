\begin{cvsubsection}{Student Asisstant}{TU Clausthal, Datacenter}{Apr 2016}

\begin{itemize}
\item I created knowledge via building a proof of concept for deploying Virtual Tunnel End Points (VTEPs) with Ansible on Linux machines for EVPN BGP/VXLAN.
\item I reduced toil from multiple hours to an automated system with automating daily email based firewall IPS/IDS alerts via the Forcepoint NGFW Python API.
\item I improved system security and reliability with setting up an OpenVAS vulnerability scanner.
\item I reduced MTTR from one work day to one hour with automating a Freeradius/Radsecproxy/MySQL based AAA infrastructure with Ansible.
\item I increased virtual machine reliability via creating and maintaining a Proxmox VE cluster consisting of 25 machines.
\item I reduced toil from multiple hours to an automated system with writing a Python client for deploying TLS certificates and private keys on a Forcepoint NGFW for TLS inspection.
\item I reduced toil and increased security via implementing a Kubernetes Cluster with micro segmentation between different applications.
\item Additional tasks were monitoring (NSCA, NRPE, SNMP), webserver (Nginx, Apache), network Automation (NAPALM, Ansible), storage (NFSv4 over Kerberos), log and netflow gathering (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and Configuration Management (Ansible).
\end{itemize}
