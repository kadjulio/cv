\begin{cvsubsection}{Student Asisstant}{TU Clausthal, Datacenter}{Apr 2016 --- April 2020}

\begin{itemize}
\item Built a proof of concept for deploying Virtual Tunnel End Points (VTEPs) with Ansible on Linux machines for EVPN BGP/VXLAN.
\item Implemented an automated system in Python for fetching IPS firewall alerts via REST API and mailing them to responsible system administrators. This reduced the toil of writing 5--25 mails daily manually.
\item Improved system security and reliability with setting up an OpenVAS vulnerability scanner.
\item Reduced MTTR from one work day to one hour with automating a Freeradius/Radsecproxy/MySQL based AAA infrastructure with Ansible.
\item Showed ownership with maintaning a Proxmox VE cluster consisting of 25 physical nodes.
\item Designed and implemented a command line tool in Python for deploying TLS certificates and private keys on a central firewall for inbound TLS inspection.
\item Evaluated Kubernetes for increasing reliability and introducing micro segmentation via namespace segregation
\item Set up a distributed monitoring system with the help of Traefik, Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring Service Level Indicators (SLIs) for different institutions within the university campus.
\item Gave a talk about Freeradius and Radsecproxy deployment via Ansible on the DFN-BT (annual German research network meetup): \endnote{\url{https://www.dfn.de/fileadmin/3Beratung/Betriebstagungen/bt70/BT70_MobileIT_Konfiguration_FreeRADIUS_und_radsecproxy_mit_Ansible_Strauf_Rebischke.pdf}}
\item Achieved a relation of LDAP users and IP addresses for writing user/IP specific firewall rules via implementing a REST API as middleware between a proprietary service, Freeradius and OpenVPN.
\item Additional key technologies being used: NSCA, NRPE, SNMP, Nginx, Apache, NAPALM, Ansible, NFSv4 over Kerberos, Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Ansible, REST APIs, Docker.
\end{itemize}
