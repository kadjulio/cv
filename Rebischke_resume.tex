\bigskip
\begin{itemize}
\item Automated the TLS keypair deployment to a central firewall for inbound TLS inspection by writing a middleware in Python that pulls TLS keypairs and pushes them via REST-API to the firewall.
\item Achieved a relation of LDAP users and IP addresses for writing user/IP specific firewall rules via implementing
a REST API as middleware between a proprietary service, Freeradius and OpenVPN
\item Reduced toil of writing 2--25 mails daily via writing a software in Pythont that fetches IPS firewall alerts via REST API and mails them
to responsible system administrators in institutes.
