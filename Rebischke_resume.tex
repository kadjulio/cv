\begin{cvsubsection}{Google Summer of Code}{CNCF}{June 2020 --- Sep 2020}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ported \textit{runlib} functionality from the \textit{in-toto} reference implementation in Python to the \textit{in-toto} implementation in Go by expanding the library with code for signing and generating \textit{in-toto} link metadata.
\end{itemize}
\end{cvsubsection}
\begin{cvsubsection}{Work Student}{Avency, Remote}{Apr 2020 --- Now}
\begin{itemize}
\item Maintained a Kubernetes Cluster in production.
\item Developed a customer portal based on the static site generator Hugo that provides blocklists for Forcepoint Firewalls.
\item Worked on a package manager for deploying static binaries on Forcepoint Firewalls.

\begin{cvsubsection}{Work Student}{Clausthal University of Technology}{Apr 2014 --- Apr 2020}
\bigskip
\begin{itemize}
\item Automated the TLS keypair deployment to a central firewall for inbound TLS inspection by writing a middleware in Python that pulls TLS keypairs and pushes them via REST-API to the firewall. The production environment had 4000 students and 1000 employees.
\item Achieved a relation of LDAP users and IP addresses for writing user/IP specific firewall rules via implementing
a REST API as middleware between a proprietary service, Freeradius and OpenVPN
\item Reduced toil of writing 2--25 mails daily via writing a software in Python that fetches IPS firewall alerts via REST API and mails them
to responsible system administrators in institutes.
\item Showed ownership by maintaining a Proxmox VE cluster consisting of 25 physical nodes.
\item Wrote a software that helps finding unused or orphaned artifacts in firewalls.
\item Evaluated Kubernetes for increasing reliability and introducing micro segmentation via namespace segregation
